						<h2>What We Do</h2>
						<p><b>Statement:</b> The United Kingdom Football Exchange&trade; is a revolutionary movement in sports betting where instead of betting on a team for just a game, you can invest in their success. This website's goal is to change how we see rags to riches soccer teams as well a possible decline of big money teams.</p>
						
					</div>
					
					<div class= "headline2">
						<h2>What Effects the Market?</h2>
						<p><b>A potential investor may be wondering, how do I make money off of this? So, the United Kingdom Football Exchange&trade; takes into account these factors into the price of a team.</b></p>
						
						<p>1. <b>Supply and Demand</b>: The market updates twice a week. Monday night at 11:59 PM EST and Thursday night at 11:59 PM EST. During these periods we assess the price of each team's value. When there is more buyers in a team, their value increases. When more people are selling, the value goes down. Keep in mind this is just one factor and will not always determine the total value of a stock.</p>
						
						<p>2. <b>Team Performance</b>: Another important factor is team performance. This includes quality wins, and losses that should've been at least a draw or more. A quality win for a club like West Bromwich Albion beating a team in the top half of the table like Tottenham or West Ham. This would lead to an increase in West Brom's stock value as they just had a quality win. Now in this scenario, Tottenham's stock would go down significantly due to the fact they just lost to West Brom. A draw would also decrease their stock due to the assumption they were heavy favorites to win the game. A team that continues to win, continues to see their stock increase. A team that continues to draw and lose, sees their stock value go down. Simple as that.</p>
						
						<p>3. <b>Management</b>: Football is not just the game being played. It's the drama around it as well. Managers get fired, and new ones get hired. A stock could see movement if a manager gets fired, and could also see movement when a new manager gets hired.</p>
						
						<p>4. <b>Transfer Window</b>: The transfer window is always a time of new faces and teams improving their squads or profiting off of their players. Stocks could see movement when teams buy important players that could help their new season campaign. However, if a team sells their best player, then their value would most likely go down due to the assumption they would not be as good next year.</p>

						<h2>How Do I Invest?</h2>
						<p>Step 1: Create an account by signing up on this website.</p>
						<p>Step 2: Invest- You can invest at any point and the market updates in price every Monday and Thursday night.</p>
						<p>Step 3: Sit back and make some money</p>

					<div class= "headline4">
						<h2>Guidelines</h2>
						<ol>
							<li>The market is valued based on the 4 factors already stated. There is no market manipulation. This is a free market. In a free market, you can make money, but you can also lose money. We do not take responsibility for your wins or losses.</li>
							<li>There is no day trading. Once you make an order you CANNOT cancel that order until the next market update.</li>
							<li>You cannot buy less than 1 share of a stock. You can buy as much of a stock as you please, but the minimum amount is 1 share.</li>
							<li>You can only buy a stock and sell in the next 4 market updates TWICE a month. Keep that in mind. You must keep a stock for at least two weeks. This is another attempt at discouraging day trading.</li>
							<li>Market Hours:</li>
								<ul>
									<li>After Monday Update: 9 AM EST Tuesday - 5 PM EST Thursday</li>
									<li>After Thursday Update: 9 AM EST Friday - 5 PM EST Monday</li>
								</ul>
							<li>Any order placed after market hours will be set with the new value when the market updates.</li>
							<li>We take a 5 percent commission after every stock purchase and sell. This is to help continue to provide a satisfactory platform for everyone.</li>
						</ol>

					<div class= "headline5">
						<h2>What Are Packs?</h2>
						<p>Packs are clusters of teams that can have expensive stocks as well as penny stocks. This adds to the allure of packs. The more expensive a pack, the better chance you have at acquiring a popular stock.</p>
						<p>Packs can have a net value more than the set price, but there is also an equal chance of the pack not being worth the set price.</p>

					<div class= "headline6">
						<h2>DISCLAIMER</h2>
						<p>This is our BETA release. Our goal is to improve our stock buying/selling UI as this project moves along. As of right now, we will be going with a simple spreadsheet layout of all the stocks until we are able to update the UI. We accept money tips, and tips of advice on how to approve our brand. We are open to feedback whether it is constructive, negative, or positive. Thanks for your support as we continue to grow!</p>
